Hi. This is Scott Allen and in this module we're going to build views

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
with the Razor view engine in ASP.NET MVC.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The topics we'll cover in this module include the Razor syntax and how to transition

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
between c sharp code and mark up inside of a Razor view.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We'll also see how to use HTML helpers to keep our view simple and how to work

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
with a layout view that defines the structure of our user interface.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
No module on views would be complete without a security discussion so we'll also talk about how

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
to avoid cross-site scripting attacks and how to use HTML encoding.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Finally I'll also show you how to use partial views and when they can be helpful.
