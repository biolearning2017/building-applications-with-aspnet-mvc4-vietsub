1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In this module, we covered a number of different topics related

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
to building views in an MVC application.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We look at the Razor syntax, and learned about implicit

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and explicit code expressions as well as code blocks.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We talked about HTML Helpers and I showed you how helpers

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
like EditorFor will help you build form inputs.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But I haven't told you the whole story there yet.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We'll see more when we start validating incoming data.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We did look at layout views and how they can define the UI structure for our application

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and I demonstrated how Razor does HTML encoding for us

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to help avoid cross-site scripting attacks.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Finally, I showed you a couple of scenarios where PartialViews can be your friend.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You can use partials to render a portion of your model in a reasonable way

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and you can also use partials and child requests with HTML.Action

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to delegate work to another controller.
