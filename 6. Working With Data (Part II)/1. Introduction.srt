Hi. This is Scott Allen and this is the second module in this course focusing on working

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
with data and models in ASP.NET MVC.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In this module we'll continue working with the data base and the Entity Framework

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and we'll build some views to edit and create data.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We'll also see how to validate incoming information and uncover more details

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:59:00,000
about the model binding and html helpers in ASP.NET MVC.
