1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this module, we added the ability to create, delete and edit restaurants

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and also added the ability to create and edit reviews.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We looked at Model Binding, some Entity Framework APIs for data updates and saw how

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to use data annotations to influence the display of the model information

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and also to validate model information.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We saw two different approaches to custom validation that work with the Model Binder

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and the MVC framework to automatically set model state and populate our error messages.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In the next module, we'll be turning out attention to JavaScript

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and adding some Ajax features to the application.
