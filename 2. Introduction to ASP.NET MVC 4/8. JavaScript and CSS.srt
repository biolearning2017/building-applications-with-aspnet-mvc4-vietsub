1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So far, we've started to see how views, models and controllers work together

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and we've also seen how you see this to write unit test for an MVC application.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But I also mentioned earlier that another goal of the MVC framework is to embrace the web

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and that means being able to use standard web technologies like HTML 5, JavaScript, and CSS 3.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We've already seen a bit about how to work with HTML.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We know the razor views that are in our views folder emit this HTML and we've already seen

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
that the project does set up to use HTML 5.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But there's a couple of other folders we haven't looked at yet,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
the scripts folder and the content folder.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Inside of the scripts folder you'll find JavaScript files.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The JavaScript files here include the popular jQuery library as well

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
as some other jQuery plug ins we'll be using later in this course,

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
plugins like jQuery validation and jQuery UI.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And the content you will find the CSS style sheet for this site.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This file site dot CSS is the file that's responsible for all the color

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and font choices that you see in the application.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let me make some basic changes to the body style here and see how that's reflected

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
in the application instead of a white background color, let's go with 3, 3, 3, and instead this

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
or that color let's change that over to white.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So essentially we're flipping the background and foreground colors.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And now once I save that file and refresh this page, you can see that influence is how

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
at least that top of the page displays.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But let me make a few more tweaks to that file and come right back.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Now I finished making a few tweaks to my CSS file.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And I've and added an image to the project.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And this is what the applications looks like now.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's still not the prettiest application in the world but this is what we're going to be working

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
on throughout the rest of the course.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And hopefully we'll be adding features and making look it better.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If you are interested in looking at the source code for this project,

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
just go to odetofoodmvc4.codeplex.com.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
From here you can come into the source code tab.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And from in the source code section you can download the latest source code.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You can also click this History link and go back and see what the code look

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:59:00,000
like at specific point in time like this point in time with the first video is nearly over.
