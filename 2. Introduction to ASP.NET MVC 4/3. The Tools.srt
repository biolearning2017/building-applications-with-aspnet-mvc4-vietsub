1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now, it's just a few minutes later and the Web Platform Installer has completed.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It didn't require any reboot on this machine which is always nice.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So, we're ready to use Visual Studio for the first time.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
But before we do, let's just a take a step back and talk

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
about the tools we're going to use in this course.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What we've done so far is set up the Web Platform Installer

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and you can launch this tool again at any time if you want to install more software.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But we've already installed the three essential tools that we need to move forward.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The first is Visual Studio.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Visual Studio is where we will write task and debug our code.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It includes editors, debuggers and shortcuts for all the technologies that we need

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
to bring together in a web application.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It can handle C sharp code.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It can also handle JavaScript HTML and CSS.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We've also installed SQL server.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Later in this course, we'll see how to persist

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and query data that's stored in a SQL server database.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And finally we've installed IIS Express.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
IIS Express is a light weight web server we can use during development

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and it doesn't require any special privileges to run.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
As a web server, this is the component that will respond to HTTP request that come

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
in from a web browser and it responds by executing the logic

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
that we build inside of our MVC application.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We won't interact with IIS Express on a regular basis.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It just pretty much sits behind the scenes and faithfully hosts and executes our application.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:59:00,000
The first step in using all these tools is to just launch Visual Studio.
