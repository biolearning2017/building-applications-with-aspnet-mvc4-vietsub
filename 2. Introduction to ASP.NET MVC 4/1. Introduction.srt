Hi, this is Scott Allen and this is the first module in the course design

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
to demonstrate everything you need to build applications with ASP.NET MVC.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This course is primarily aimed at developers who are new to ASP.NET MVC,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
but even if you've been working with the framework I hope to show you a few tricks.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We'll be starting at the very beginning in this first module.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'll first show you how to install all the tools that you need.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We'll be using Visual Studio express 2012 for the web which is a free tool

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
for building web applications, but you can use other editions

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
of Visual Studio 2012 if you want to follow along.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
By the end of this first module, you'll see how to create and run your first application

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and also have an understanding of the design goals of the MVC framework.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So, let's get started.
