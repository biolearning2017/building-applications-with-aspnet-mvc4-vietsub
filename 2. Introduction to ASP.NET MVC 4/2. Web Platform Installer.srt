1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What we're looking at now is a machine with a fresh new copy of Microsoft Windows 8.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I don't even have any development tools installed yet.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So, I will go to a web browser and search for web platform installer.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This will work on Windows 7 also by the way.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If you haven't moved to Windows 8, but when I do that search I should see a link that I can click

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
on to go to a page where I can download Microsoft Web Platform Installer.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
As this button implies this is a free download.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's a tool that you can just tell it to run and it will go out and be able

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
to download software products and frameworks and libraries and install them on your computer.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It just takes a little bit of time to initialize, but what we're going to look

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
for is Visual Studio 2012 web edition.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
When I install that it will also install a web server that I can use to host my web application

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,000
on this machine and a SQL server instance that we can use to save data for an application.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So, now that it is initialized, I can come into the search box that's in the top right here

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and I will search for 2012 web and click enter.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The very first search result here is Visual Studio Express 2012 for Web

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
with Windows Azure SDK that is the product that I want.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So, I'll click add.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You click add.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You can go through and search for other products that you might want to install,

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
but you'll notice if you click on the hyperlink here.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This will show you everything it's going to install here

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
that includes Visual Studio 2012, some Windows Azure tools.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It also includes IIS 8 Express and Microsoft SQL Express LocalDB Edition.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We'll be talking about in using those two tools during this course and just selecting

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
that one item will give me everything that I need.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So, I will close this out and go ahead and tell the Web Platform Installer

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
that downloads everything I need and install this.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll need to accept some license agreements and chances are,

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
it might need to reboot the machine once or twice,

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:59:00,000
but we'll come back once installation is finished.
