1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this first module I've demonstrated how to use the Web Platform Installer

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
to create a development environment or you can build ASP.NET MVC Web Applications.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
With just a few clicks we were able to install Visual Studio, SQL Server and the MVC Framework.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We still how to create a new MVC application and we talked

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
about the Model, View, Controller design pattern.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In the rest of this course we will be again drilling

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
into specific areas of the MVC Framework.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And see how to build Controllers, how to build Models, send story information in SQL Server.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We'll take a very close look at Razor and also how to use jQuery plugins

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
to add Ajax features to our application.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We'll be writing more unit test and then

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
in the end we'll deploy our application live to the internet.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Thanks to Microsoft Windows Azure websites.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So don't go away, we're only getting started with this excitement.
