Hi, this is Scott Allan.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And in this module I'll be focusing on configuration

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and deployment of an ASP.NET MVC application.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'll talk about the various configuration files that you'll find on the machine,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and what those configuration files mean to your application.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'll also be transforming my development machine into a webserver

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
by installing internet information services -- or IIS --

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and building a web deployment package to install the application into IIS.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Then finally, we'll take a look at deploying

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
to the cloud using Microsoft's Windows Azure websites.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:59:00,000
