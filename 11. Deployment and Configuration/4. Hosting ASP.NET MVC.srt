1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now that we understand a little bit about ASP.NET configuration,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
let's see how to deploy an application and how to change configurations on a deployed website.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
First, understand that when you build an MVC application, you're producing a .DLL file

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
with the application logic inside.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That's going to sit in the bin directory of your project.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
DLL's don't execute by themselves.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
They need some sort of host process to load them into memory.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And for websites that host processes, also then responsible

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
for delivering HTTP requests to the logic inside the DLL.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We've been using IIS Express as the host for our application so far.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
IIS Express makes things very easy for development because it runs with our identity,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and we can start and stop the webserver whenever we need to.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But if you're deploying an application for real on the internet or intranet,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
chances are you'll be using the full version of internet information services.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You can install IIS on nearly any version of Windows, but it is off by default

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
on nearly all versions of Windows.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So you might need to go into Windows features

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
or use the web platform installer to get IIS onto a machine.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let me show you how that works.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What I want to do now is transform my development environment

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
into a server type environment by installing IIS.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And one of the easiest ways to do that is to use the web platform installer.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You might remember that we used this in the introduction

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
to this course to install Visual Studio.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now, I'm going to launch it, and install IIS as well as a few other tools.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So up here in the top right where I can search, I'm going to search for IIS and ASP.NET.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That should find me this entry; IIS with ASP.NET 4.5.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Let's add that.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I also want to be able to manage IIS.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So let me search for IIS, and select the IIS management console.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And I'm also going to install sql server --

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
a sql server express edition because even though we already have local DB installed,

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
it turns out that using local DB from IIS is a bit of a pain.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It can be done, but it requires a lot of configuration and it's configuration

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
that you'd never have to do, because when you really do deploy to production,

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
chances are you'll have a real instance of sql server and a real license,

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and everything will be set up for you.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm just going to install sql server express just to get this running under IIS,

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and let you see what it would look like.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm also going to install sql management tools because chances are we're going to have to log

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
into that database and tweak some permissions.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So I will install the sql server management studio.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Four components to install just click the install button.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I will need to fill out some information about the SA password.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
SA stands for system administrator.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's the all-powerful account inside of sql server.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm just giving it an initial password.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I can click continue and accept, and we'll come back after all

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
of this has finished downloading and installing.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Now the web platform installer has finished.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I should be able to exit out.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And I should be able to open up internet explorer and go to local host.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And I can see that IIS 8 is running on this machine.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's a good sign.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is exactly where we want to deploy our application.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So if I come to local host I won't see the IIS banner page.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll instead see Ode To Food.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Let's check to make sure the other components installed too.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm going to go and search for sql management studio, and once this has initialized I will try

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
to connect to the sql express instance.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
There's two ways to get to a local sql express instance.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You can specify a server name/sqlexpress.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You can also use a period here to specify that you want to go

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
to the local sql express instance.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I should be able to click connect.

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And that looks good, there's no databases there yet.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's where we're going to put our Ode To Food database.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You can also use this management tool by the way, to connect to local DB.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
A connection string is just like you see in your web.config file.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's local DB inside a parenthesis, slash V11.0.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And when I connect to that I can see our Ode To Food DB as well

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
as some other temporary databases that Visual Studio has created for things

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
like storing the unit test results.

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And finally, there was one more tool that we installed.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That was the IIS management console.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It wants me to launch the web platform installer.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We don't need to do that right now.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I just want to see that IIS is running on this machine.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Inside of this manager you can go through and modify any of the settings for this server.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
A lot of this just maps down to the same XML files

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
that we've been looking at -- configuration files.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Inside of a server I can see two nodes: there's application pools.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
An application pool is a process that a web application will run inside of.

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We'll be using the default application pool.

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I can already see there's one application running there.

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's the website that we went to that just has the IIS banner.

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
If you go into the task manager for Windows --

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and in Windows 8 the task manager is a little bit fancier

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
than the previous versions of Windows.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So let me go to more details, and go to the details tab.

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Inside of here I should be able to find a W3WP.EXE.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's a world wide web worker process .EXE.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That will be the process that will host our MVC application default app pool.

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And also, inside the manager if I drill into sites I can see there's one site in here now.

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's the default website.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's where we will deploy our application.

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You can have additional websites, and you can have web applications listed under that website.

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We want to deploy our application to the root of this website.

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So that's what we'll get ready to do next.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
( Silence )
