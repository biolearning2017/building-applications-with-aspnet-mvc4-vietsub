1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now that we've deployed to IIS on a local server,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
let's deploy to IIS running in the cloud with Windows Azure.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
To get started, I'll to go the Windows Azure website; WindowsAzure.com.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And if you haven't heard of Azure, it is Microsoft's Cloud platform

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
where you can host websites, databases and virtual machines.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You can run Windows or Linux, and you can start small and scale up really big just

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
by adding more resources for Microsoft's global data centers.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If I want to put a new website into Azure, I would first log into the Azure portal.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This is currently in preview, but by the time you watch this video it might be live.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll first need to sign in with my live ID.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
( Silence )

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And the first screen that is about to come up will be a screen

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
where I can see everything I have deployed in Azure under this account.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's my portal where I can add new databases, new websites,

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
new virtual machines, new media services.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's also where I can manage my existing services, and where I can create new services,

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
which is what I'll want to do when this is finished loading.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We want to add a new website and give the website a database for storage.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And you can see I have a few things out there already; couple websites, couple databases,

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
a virtual machine, a storage account.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But I want to create a new website with a database to host Ode To Food.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
First I'll need to give my website a URL.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What will happen is that my website will be OdeToFood.AzureWebsites.net.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I can also get a DNS and point this to my website in Azure,

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
so it could just be OdeToFood.com; but we'll leave it as AzureWebsites.net for right now.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I get to pick a region for the data center.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'll pick the eastern United States.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I want to create a new sequel database.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
My connection string name -- let's call it OdeToFoodDB.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And in the next step I'll need to specify my database settings.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This is the name that I want to use.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The server will be a sql server that I already have in Azure; I just need to log in properly.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And I can show you what the advanced database settings look like.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This is where I can select my addition wherever business The maximum database size one gigabyte

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
will be good enough to start, and my collation.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And with all that in place I can select okay,

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and Azure will go off and start creating this website.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
As soon as it's done creating that I'll have a website on the internet that I can go to.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It'll have just the blank Azure template.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And what we'll need to do is publish our website now, and set it to local IIS to this website.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
There are a number of publishing options available with Azure websites.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You can see them in the list here.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You can use GIT, you can use TFS, you can use Visual Studio or WebMatrix.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We're going to be using Visual Studio; it's very simple.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
First I'll go to this website.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This brings up the dashboard where I can look at things like how much CPU has been used

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
by the website over the last 24 hours or over the last week.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But it's also where I can download a publishing profile.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Remember when we were publishing to IIS we created a publishing profile.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This is going to download one for me that I could just plug into Visual Studio,

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and it will have all the settings that it needs to upload my website here.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And we just downloaded it into my downloads folder.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And now, let me go into Visual Studio, and let's publish this website again.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm going to go to the profile tab, because I want to import this new profile.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And there it is; the publish settings file.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If you open that up, it's just a big scary amount of XML inside, but it has everything

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
that I need to get this to the right server.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So it already includes the URL, the site name, the user name, passwords.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
All you need to do is -- I can validate the connection; make sure this is going to work.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And that looks good.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So let's go to the next phase where you can see we're going

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
to again deploy a release mode build.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It is already understood that my default connections string will probably want

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
to point to that sql server in the cloud.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It will have populated the server name and the user name

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and the password, and everything I need.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We're not going to run the entity code first migrations.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
We're taking explicit control of our migrations in the code.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll just go to next.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This allows me to preview what it is going to push out.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But I'm feeling lucky, so I'm just going to click publish.

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Since this is going over the internet, it might take a little bit of time.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The first time you need to publish it needs to push out a lot of assemblies,

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
a lot of data going over the network.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We'll come back in a second when it's finished pushing everything up into the cloud.

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And the publishing operation has just succeeded.

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I should now be able to go back into the browser.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Let's refresh this website.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And I'm now running on AzureWebsites.net, very simple to deploy.

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
All my functionality should be there.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The database is working.

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We see the database.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That means I should be able to log into this application.

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
( Silence )

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That was successful.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I should also be able to go and create new restaurant at this point.

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And since I just launched, I don't expect a lot of traffic.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The wonderful thing about ager is that this is now in someone else's data center.

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
They make sure the electricity stays on.

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
They're making sure they take backups at all the right time.

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And as this grows in popularity, I can come in and scale this thing out.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I can reserve my own machine, crank up the number of instances,

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
so I have more instances available to serve up all the requests that are coming in.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And of course, you'll pay for the resources that you use, but hopefully you'll be making money

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
from all of the customers that come to the website,

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and that will pay for everything that you need in Azure.

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:59:00,000
( Silence )
