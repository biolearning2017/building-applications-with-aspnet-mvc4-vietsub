1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This concludes this module on configuration and deployment where we looked

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
at all the configuration files that are in effect when running a web application,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and we also deployed to IIS both locally and in Windows Azure.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This also concludes my ASP.NET MVC 4 course.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We've seen how to work with routing, controllers, and razor views.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We added javascript and used jQuery and jQuery UI to add Ajax features to the application.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And we also saw how to work with foreign authentication and the membership provider

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
that comes with our MVC application.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I hope you enjoyed this course and were able to use the videos

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
to either jumpstart your MVC development or solidify your existing knowledge

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
of the framework, just a reminder that all the code

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
that we've been working on is published on codeplex.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If you look at the history of the check-ins you'll see I did one check-in for each module.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So if you want to go back in time to a specific point and work along

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
with the video, you should be able to do that.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And now that we are finished I'd just like to say thanks for listening,

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and good luck with your software development endeavors.
