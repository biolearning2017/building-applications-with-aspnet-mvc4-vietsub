00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Configuration files and .NET are XML files that control everything

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
about the environment your code will execute inside of.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
For web applications, this includes the authentication settings as we saw

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
in the security module of this course, but config files also control the compilation

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
of use, database connection strings, cryptography settings,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
custom errors settings, and much, much more.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The configuration system in .NET is also extensible,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
so if you want to build your own custom configuration section,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
all you need to do is write some classes to support that.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not going to show you that specific scenario in this module,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
but I will demonstrate an easy way for you to store custom settings in a configuration file.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Inside of Visual Studio I'm going to open up the web.config file that's in the root

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
of this project; the one we've been using repeatedly throughout this course.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is where we specify the connection string for the database that we want to use.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We've also looked at the globalization settings in here, we've created some cash profiles,

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
we've configured custom errors, and we've looked at authentication.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So there are various components of ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC, and also of the webserver itself

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
that look in this configuration file for settings.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And so, the obvious question might be what if I want

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
to keep my own settings inside of web.config?

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
One of the easiest things to do if you just have a simple value that you want to store is

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
to add it to the app settings section.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Right here I can add a new setting with a key of mail server and give it a value.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And now, I want to be able to retrieve that value inside of my MVC application; let's say,

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
somewhere inside of the home controller.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let's just read that value out, and put it into a view.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The easiest way to do that would be to just put it into viewbag.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And the way I can read that setting is to use configuration manager that's

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
in a namespace system.configuration.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Configuration manager will give me access to connection strings, to app settings;

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
really to anything that's in a config file.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But here I'm explicitly asking for the mail server app setting.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We'll grab that value.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We'll put it in viewbag, and in the index view that that action renders.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let's delete some of the culture globalization stuff that we were fiddling with

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and instead write out viewbag.mailserver to see if we've retrieved this correctly.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll do a build and refresh the homepage of the application,

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and there you can see we get out mail.server.com.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So that worked.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And configuration manager makes it very easy to grab app settings,

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and really any setting that's in a web.config file.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And this is the place where you want to put things

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
that you don't necessarily want to hardcode.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So connection strings, server names, file share names; all of those types

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
of things can go into your configuration file.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That way, you can change them just by changing the config file and you don't have

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
to recompile and redeploy all your binaries.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:59:00,000
