1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
There's just a couple housekeeping tasks that I want to take care

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
of to get my application ready for deployment.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
These mostly revolve around the database.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The first thing I'd like to do is re-do our database migrations.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We've been a little loose with our migrations.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We've been running with automatic migrations enabled, which means,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
we don't get explicit migration scripts; or migration files in the migrations folder.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Instead when we go to the package manager and go to update database,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
it just makes whatever changes in the database that it sees fit to do.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Whatever is needed to sink up the schema with our models.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But for my first deployment, I'd like to baseline the database and get us into a state

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
where we will not be using automatic migrations anymore.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We'll be a little more careful because after we deploy, we'll get live data in the database.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We need to start taking care of things, and making sure we're managing the schema properly.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
At least that's how I feel.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I essentially want to restart the migrations.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
There's nothing in the database that I need right now.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
All the data comes from our seed method down here, which while I'm in here,

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm also going to remove the 1000 restaurants that we create just to test paging and sorting

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
because I don't want to deploy those either.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And I will also delete our initial database migration script.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm just going to recreate this from scratch using a brand new database.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And the definition of the schema will be based on what is in our model classes right now;

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
what's a restaurant, what's a review.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And the best way to do this with entity framework migrations is to come in

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and also delete your database, so it doesn't see anything there and knows

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
that you want to start from scratch.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And I can do this through the sql server management studio just by highlighting Ode

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
To Food and right-clicking and saying delete; or hitting the delete key.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm going to tell sql management studio to close any existing connections

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
to make sure we can drop this database.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And it looks like it's gone.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And now reopen the package manager console, and let's create our initial migration.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Remember, we're not using automatic migrations anymore.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We won't be able to just say update database and have it create a database for us.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We need to have a migration script there first.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So add migration, initial create.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And I need to make sure that this executes us under the right project;

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
not OdeToFood.test, but OdeToFood.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's where my entity framework DB context class is.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And now we will have an initial create that includes everything that we've been using,

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
the user profile class, restaurants, restaurant reviews.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And this is the point where I would also go through this file

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and make sure all the column sizes are reasonable.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Make sure indexes are applied.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But for this application we can forge ahead.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Now, the other thing I'm going to want to do with this application is that it when deploys,

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I want it to run the migrations automatically.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
There's a way to do that through configuration, but we're actually going to do it through code.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And the other thing I want to do before I forget is make sure

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
that web security does not get initialized more than once

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
because if you call initialized database more than once,

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
this line of code will throw an exception and stop everything.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's very easy to check if web security is initialized.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If web security initialized -- and put a not in front of here --

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
so if it's not initialized, we will initialize the database.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And the reason I'm putting that check there is because now we're going

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
to be running migrations when the web application runs.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So this initialized database connection can run when the web application is running.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And we have another call to initialize the database connection here during

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
application start.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm also going to put a guard around this.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Although I'm fairly certain it's always going to run before we reach this point because I want

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
to run the migrations before we get into this point in application start.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm still going to put that check there just to make sure it doesn't throw and exception.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And it is during the application start event when I want to run the migrations,

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and I can do that using a class called DB migrator.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It is in the system.data.entity.migrations namespace.

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So I'm just going to bring that in.

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And we give it our configuration class that is in our project in a migrations folder.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So also bring that namespace in.

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And then just tell it to update.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That will run any schema changes that need applied.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That will run the seed method to make sure the database is populated.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And the reason I'm doing this in code instead of in my web.config file, which is possible is

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
because I want to make very sure about when these migrations run.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I want them to run at this point before web security tries to initialize the database.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If you're not using forms authentication or if you are using forms authentication,

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
but not using web security, you wouldn't have to use this approach.

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You could just put some configuration in place that would run the migrations automatically.

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And the tools as we'll see in just a bit, will automatically add that configuration for us.

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll point that out when we get to it.

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:59:00,000
But for now, I think we've reached the point where we are ready to deploy.
