1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In this module, we took our first steps with the Entity Framework.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We let it take our C Sharp classes and not only save objects in the database

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
but we also let it create the database for us.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This was all done using the DbSet and DbContext classes of the Entity Framework.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We also used EF Migrations to seed the database

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
with some initial restaurants and manage the schema.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Finally, I showed you a few different LINQ queries to give you an idea of what is possible

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
when querying a database with the Entity Framework.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In the next module, we're going to build on what we learned here to look at editing

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and inserting data along with all the features you need in those scenarios,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:59:00,000
features like validation and from the error messages.
