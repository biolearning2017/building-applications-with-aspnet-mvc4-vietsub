Hi! This is Scott Allen and this module of the course is devoted to Data.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In this first Data module, we want to start using a real database with our application.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So the focus of the first module is to bring SQL Server into the picture.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In the next Data module, we'll look at other data-related features

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
in the MVC framework, features like model validation.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What I'll demonstrate in this first module is how to use a technology known

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
as the Entity Framework and combine the Entity Framework

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
with the plain simple C Sharp class definitions we've been working with to build an application

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that uses SQL Server to persist data.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We will see how to query data using link in the Entity Framework,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and also use the Entity Framework Migrations

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to manage our database schema from C Sharp and Visual Studio.
