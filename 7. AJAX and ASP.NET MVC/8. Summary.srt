1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this module, we added some AJAX features to our application using jQuery,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
jQuery UI, and our own custom JavaScript.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We brought controller actions to return JSON and implemented paging and searching

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
with async behavior to provide an updated page without disrupting the user experience.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Finally, we saw quite a few data dash attributes in our HTML.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We saw how we could work with those attributes from our script

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and also have the MVC framework uses those attributes to add AJAX functionality

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:59:00,000
through AJAX helpers and also to support client validation.
