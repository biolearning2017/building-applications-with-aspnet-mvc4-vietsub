Hi, this is Scott Allen.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And in this module, we will look at adding AJAX features to an MVC application.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Specifically, we'll look at the AJAX helpers offered by the MVC framework.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We'll also spend time using jQuery and jQuery UI to work directly in script code.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'll show you how client validation works, how to minify and bundle your scripts,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
how to produce JSON from your application,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and what to do with JSON once you have it on the client.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I will do all these things while adding features to the application.
