00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In reality, it is almost impossible to pick the correct cache duration setting

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
in a development environment.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You need to put the application into a production like environment.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Put it under load, take some measurements, and then make some adjustments.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You might found out that you're using too much memory and caching requests

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that just aren't being used or you might find that you're not caching enough.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
For these reasons, ASP.net allows you to specify a cache profile in the output cache attribute.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
A cache profile then is something that's stored

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
in your web.config file and can specify a duration.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's underneath a section named caching and it's inside of here

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
where you can put duration values.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
As this example demonstrates, you can have multiple cash profiles

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and you reference the cache profile by name in the output cache attribute.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I generally recommend using cache profiles instead of hard code and cache settings

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
because first of all, it avoids repetition in the cache attributes.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If you want to double the duration inside of all of your cache attributes,

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
you don't have to do a search and replace throughout the code.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You just go to one location in your web.config file.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's also easier to change the cache settings once the application is deployed

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
because now all you do is edit the config file and then you avoid changing the settings

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
in code, recompiling, and redeploying.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And typically when you're doing performance tuning on an application,

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
you need to run it while taking some measurements.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Then you tweak the cache settings and then you run it again

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
to make sure you did really get better results and it's not getting worse.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And you'll do this over and over again until you reach some goal like reduced memory usage

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
or reduced CPU or an increase in how many requests per second your application handles.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Inside our application if I wanted to use a cache profile instead of this hard code

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
of duration, all I would need to do is come into the root level web.config and somewhere inside

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
of system.web, create a caching element.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We're going to create output cache settings.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Notice you get intel sense (phonetic) the entire way through and we're going

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
to create multiple output cache profiles.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So let's add one called long that has a duration of 300 seconds and add another one

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
with a duration of 3 seconds called short.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And of course, you could have as many of these as you want.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Now I just need to reference one of these from the home controller.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So instead of having a duration, have cache profile equals long.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And the application should behave just like it did before.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Just now I have my numbers inside of a config file instead

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
of hard coded inside of the controller.
