Hi, this is Scott Allen and in this module I'll show you how to use some

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
of the infrastructure features of ASP.net inside an MVC application.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In this module, I'll show you how to use the underlying ASP.net caching engine

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
to improve the performance of an application.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We'll also see how to work with ASP.net resource files to globalize

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and localize some application to support multiple cultures.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Finally I'll show you some techniques you can use to enable diagnostics

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and logging inside of an MVC application.
