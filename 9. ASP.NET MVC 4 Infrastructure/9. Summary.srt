00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In this module, we spent some time with the ASP.net output cache attribute.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We saw how to use the attribute and vary by location and vary by header

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to hopefully increase the performance of the application.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I say hopefully because I never took any performance measurements before

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and after caching and the only way to know for sure that you've helped is

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
to start taking hard measurements.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So I encourage you to always take measurements before you start applying cache attributes.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We also looked at the localization features of ASP.net and saw how we can let resource files

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and ASP.net take care of most of the hard work.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We saw, for example, how the globalization settings

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
in web.config can automatically give us different formatting behaviors

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
for different languages depending on the client's accept language header.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Finally, we took a look at diagnostics and we now have ELMAH added to the application

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and watching for errors and giving us an easy way to see the unhandled exceptions that occur.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This was just a quick look at all the functionality that ELMAH can provide.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
