00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The next topic we want to talk about it is how to localize an application.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
There are two important settings for every thread of execution

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
that determine how an application behaves under different cultures.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The first setting is exposed by the static current culture property of the thread class.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This property tells the run time how to format strings.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
For instance, if we have a dot 2 (phonetic) string on a date time or a dot 2 on a currency,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
then how should the date time be formatted and what currency symbol should be used?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Is it going to be a euro, a dollar, a rupee or a yen?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Another important setting is exposed from the static current UI culture property.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This setting impacts how the run time performs resource loading which we're about to look at.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You can set these properties in your own code.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For example, if you have one of those sites

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
where you let the user select what language they want to see and that's in a drop down list

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
or they click on a flag icon, that would be a scenario

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
where you would set these properties manually.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Or you can let ASP.net set these properties for you.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
ASP.net will set the properties based

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
on the accept language HTTP header that the client's browser sends.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
In order for ASP.net to do this automatically though,

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
you do have to add a globalization section to your web.doc config file and set the culture

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and UI culture attributes to auto.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let's see how these settings make our application behave.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
( Silence )

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Inside of the index view for the home controller,

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
let's do a little experiment with the globalization settings.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So first I'm going to add a code block

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
that defines two variables, amount which is a decimal.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That's what the m suffix is and sum date

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
which is a date time representing July 9th of the year 2002.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And now I will add some code to output these two variables by calling two string.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Amount will call two string and pass in a C parameter which means please format this

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
as a currency and with sum date, we'll just call two short date string.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And before we run the application, I will come into the web config and inside of system.web,

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I will add that globalization section that we talked about.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We need to set culture equals auto and we need to set UI culture equals auto.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And now let's see how this behaves.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I will run the application with Internet Explorer and since my default culture

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
on this machine is United States English, I see the currency value is formatted

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
with a dollar sign and the date is formatted as month, day, year.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But now let me come into the Internet Explorer options.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So ALT T will open the tools menu.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Come into internet options.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Under appearance, go to languages and here I can set language preferences.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's from here where I can add a language and in this list, let me select French

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and not the Canadian French but the real Francois from France and let me take

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
that language and move it up in the list.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So this is now essentially my preferred language and I will close this out and refresh the page.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
( Silence )

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And now my currency is formatted with a comma and a euro sign

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and the date format has also changed.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It is now day month year.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So what we've done so far is to see how globalization works

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and this is just a starting point for localization.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We've changed how data amounts were formatted but we would also need to go

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
through the application and take care of string literals like search by name if we really want

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
to localize those to a specific culture

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
because all the literal texts in here are still in English.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Let's see how we can change that.
