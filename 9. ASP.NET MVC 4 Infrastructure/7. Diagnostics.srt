00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Our last infrastructure topic is diagnostics.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Diagnostics help us answer the question just what is our application doing?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When did it start?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
When it restart?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Are there any unhandled exceptions?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Are there any authorization failures?

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
To get this type of information, there are a number of options available.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
First, ASP.net does have a health monitoring system you can configure to report on everything

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
from application start to application end and all the events in between,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
exceptions, failures, compilation events.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
There are also many third party options for logging and monitoring.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Logfornet is a popular open source library you can reference

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
to build your own logging infrastructure.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And the patterns and practices team at Microsoft also has an application logging block.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
One really popular open source library is ELMAH, e l m a h. That stands

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
for Error Logging Handles and Modules.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
ELMAH can capture events about your application and store them in a variety of destinations,

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
xml files, text files, databases.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It could even post them to Twitter and it has some prebuilt UI

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
to show you the events it has recorded.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Let's take a look.
