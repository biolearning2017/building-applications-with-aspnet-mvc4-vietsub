Hi, this is Scott Allen, and welcome to my course on ASP.NET MVC 4.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In this course, we'll start building an application from scratch, and throughout the course we will see how

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to build an entire application using the C# language

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
that stores data in a SQL Server database. Since this is a web application, we'll also be using JavaScript,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
HTML, and CSS. But the primary focus is on ASP.NET MVC, so we will spend our time learning about the M and V

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and C in MVC, that is models, views, and controllers. We'll see how controllers can respond to a user's

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
request, and how that controller can build a model, and how they can send the model to a view when we build

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
the UI for our web page. We'll also be using models to update data in the database, and that's the part of

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
the course where we can learn how to work with HTML forms and validate the data a user has entered.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
By the end of the course, you'll be in a good position to work on your own ASP.NET MVC applications and build

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
a web application for your users. I do expect that you are already familiar with the C# language and know

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
some of the basics of a web application, like how to use HTML.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
If not, we have plenty of courses on Pluralsight that cover everything from the HTTP protocol itself to using

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
JavaScript, CSS, and HTML together, as well as courses on the C# language.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I hope you enjoy the course.
