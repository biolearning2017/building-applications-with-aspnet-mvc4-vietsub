1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The OdeToFood application we've been working on was created

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
with the internet application project template.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You might remember that from the first module.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Internet applications use Forms-Based Authentication by default,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but I want to demonstrate Windows Authentication, and changing this application

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
over to use Windows Authentication is a bit messy.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's possible but it's messy.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So instead of getting messy I'll launch a second instance of Visual Studio

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and we'll create a new temporary project just to look at how Windows Authentication works.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So a new project using MVC 4, I don't really care about the name

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
because we won't be spending anytime with this.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So we don't need a unit test project either.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I just want to make sure instead of creating an internet application,

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I create an intranet application and then I'll click okay and be back

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
in a second once Visual Studio has the setup.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now the project is ready to go and Visual Studio will open up a readme.text file by default

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
when you create an intranet application.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It'll list a couple manual steps that you have to go through in order for this to work

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
because many web servers today ship with features turned off by default.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And one of the features that is off by default is the ability to do Windows Authentication.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
To fix that, I need to come into to the MvcApplication and open up the property window.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And I do that by going to View, Properties Window.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
In this case I cannot right-click on the Project and go to Properties.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That takes me to the wrong place.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I need to open up the Properties Window by clicking this or pressing F4.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And that allows me to set some properties on the development server.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Remember the development server is IIS Express.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's a little application running down here in the system tray.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We've hardly looked at it at all.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It just sits there and runs in the background to process our request.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We need to come in for IIS Express and tell it to enable Windows Authentication.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And that's all the configuration we really need right now.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Everything in an intranet application requires authentication by default.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So it will not let a user in until it knows who they are.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And that means if I run the application,

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
the first thing Internet Explorer will do is pop up a log in box.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And you might wonder, well, what's so integrated about Windows Authentication

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
if Internet Explorer is always going to ask me to log in?

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But this behavior is peculiar to Internet Explorer

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
because Internet Explorer will only automatically log you into a site if it thinks

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
that site is on your local network.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And by default, Internet Explorer doesn't consider local host to be on the local network.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If I want to change that experience I would have to go into the Tools menu in IE,

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
so Alt T will open up the menu, and then I can go to Internet Options.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Go to the Security tab.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Click on Local Intranet and then go to sites.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Go to Advanced, and finally I reach a dialog where I can tell Internet Explorer

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
that local host should be considered an intranet site.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And the reason this is important is because if we look at the custom settings

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
for a local internet, essentially what are all the settings that are applied in this soon,

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and I explore all the way down, you'll see right here

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
that Internet Explorer will only automatically log

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
on for a website that's in the intranet zone.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And it doesn't matter if you've created an internet site or an internet site with MVC,

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
this is completely based on IE's heuristics

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
on determining what's an internet site and what's not an internet site.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But now, local host should be considered in the internet zone

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and if I close all these dialog boxes, and close the browser and press Ctrl F5 to run this again,

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Internet Explorer will automatically log me in using my current credentials for this machine

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
or my domain if I have a domain controller.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The machine is WIN8VPC, my user name is Scott and that can automatically display it

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
because I've been authenticated, even here on the Homepage.

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And no log in box was required this time.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Where does this text come from?

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's in the layout view for this application.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If we go to Views, Shared, Layout, we'll find there's a section

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
in here using User.Identity.Name.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So the user property and User.Identity, they're both available for Windows Authentication

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and also Forms-based Authentication.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You can do things like find out the user's name.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You can also use identity to find out if the user has been authenticated

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
or not and how they were authenticated.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And we'll see User.Identity again when we come back to Forms-Based Authentication.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But for now, this is how Windows Authentication works.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And the one other primary difference between this application and the OdeToFood application,

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
if I come into web.config, inside of here there will be a section called "Authentication",

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and you can see the mode is equal to Windows.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Inside the OdeToFood application, we have that same section,

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
authentication section, but the mode is equal to forms.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And that's essentially what's telling ASP.NET

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
if it's using Windows or Forms-Based Authentication.

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:59:00,000
