1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now let's look at forcing a user to authenticate.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
First, I'm going to remove the RequireHttps attribute that we put on the log on action

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
because I do not have an SSL certificate set up.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And instead, we'll talk about a different attribute, the Authorize attribute.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's imagine that for some reason, you have some secret members only information inside

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
of the About page for the application.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In that case, what I would want to do is use an Authorize attribute here.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Authorize sounds like it's more about authorization than authentication.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But when you use the Authorize attribute like this with no other parameters, essentially,

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
you're specifying the type of authorization that says, only authenticated users are authorize

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
to invoke this controller action.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So before we get into the About action, a user has to be logged in.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And just by having that attribute there, if I do a build and we come back out to the application,

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
let me go to the homepage and close the Developer Tools.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And from the homepage I'm currently logged in.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So I'll also log off and now try to go to the About page.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And ASP.NET MVC has detected that Authorize attribute.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It knows I have to be at least logged in into this application before it can view that.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So it redirects me to the log in page where I can log in.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And notice that the ReturnUrl includes /Home/About,

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
it's been URL encoded with percent 2f.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But it's /Home/About is the ReturnUrl, that way once I log in MVC will be able

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
to redirect me back to where I was trying to get to which is the About page.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Now if you're wondering how MVC knew to send me to /Account/Login when it detected that I needed

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
to authenticate, that is something that you can configure in an application.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
If you look at the root web.config in the project, at the authentication section,

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
the mode is equal to forms, and we have a loginUrl specified

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
in the forms element underneath that authentication element.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So the loginUrl tells the MVC framework where to go to authenticate a user.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The timeout value here specifies how long the user will be authenticated after logging in.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And this number is specified in minutes, so 2,880 minutes.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But coming back to our Authorize attribute, like many of these attributes,

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
you can apply them at the action level.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You can also take something like the Authorize attribute and apply it at the controller level.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So I'll remove it from the About action

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and let's just apply it to the entire HomeController.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now the user would need to be authenticated to do anything with the HomeController.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If there were just a couple of things that you wanted a user to be able to do,

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
an anonymous user to be able to do, there is an AllowAnonymous attribute.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I can place that-- let's say on the index action.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That will at least allow a user to get to the homepage of the application without logging in.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So let's try this real quick.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Authorize is at the controller level.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
AllowAnonymous is on the index action.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So if I log off then I come back out here to the homepage

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and it's viewing the homepage just fine.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And if I try to go to About or Contact, now I need to log in.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But before I log in, let me show you a couple of other things that you can do with Authorize.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You can be a little more specific about who is allowed into the HomeController.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You can specify users.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So I could say Users equals sallen, plall.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So you can have a comma separated list of users.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And having that in place, if I login as sallen, I should be able to get somewhere.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So sallen and my password, and now I can get to the Contact page.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But it's not very frequently that you can specify specific users except

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
for perhaps an admin user or a super user.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's more common often to include roles instead of specific users.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And then you could say roles equal something like administrators and sales.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
These users and roles parameters, by the way,

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I should point out that they also work with Windows Authentication.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
When you specify users, you'd be specifying users in active directory.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
When you specify roles, you'd be specifying groups in Windows.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But now that I've added roles to my Authorize attribute, I've hit a bit of a stumbling block

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
because I do not have any roles defined.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We saw in the Database Explorer that there is a table where you can store roles,

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
but I don't have any user interface available for me to create roles.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We'll look at a way to populate some of these membership tables next.

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:59:00,000
