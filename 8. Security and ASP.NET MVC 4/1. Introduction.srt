Hi. This is Scott Allen.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In this module is we'll look at the security features of ASP.NET MVC.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In this module I want to show you how to work with users and roles and also how to use OpenID

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and OAuth so your customers can sign in to your website using a third party

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
like Microsoft, Google, or Facebook.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I also want to show you some of the attacks that you'll face

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
if you deploy an application on a web server.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So we'll look at cross-site request forgeries

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and how to make your application resist such an attack.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We'll start by looking at authentication and see how we can use Windows Integrated Authentication

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
for internet style apps and forms-based authentication for web applications.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:59:00,000
