Hi, this is Scott Allen and this module looks at test-driven development

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and unit testing with the "ASP.NET MVC Framework".

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In this module, I want to show you how to use test-driven development

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
to drive the design of a feature.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We'll look at the TDD cycle, which is red, green, re-factor.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
First, you write a failing test which gives you a red result in the "Test Runner".

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Then you make the test pass, which gives you a green result.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And then you re-factor the code to improve the design.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm also going to demonstrate how to unit test controllers, and how to build test doubles

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
to control the environment the controller executes inside of when we test them.

00:00:34,000 --> 00:59:00,000
