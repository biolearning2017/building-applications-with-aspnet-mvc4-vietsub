00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this module, we looked at test-driven development

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and unit testing with "ASP dot" and "MVC".

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I demonstrated the test-first development cycle

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
of red-green re-factor to implement a new feature.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We saw how TDD is more about design than quality control, but a wonderful side effect

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
of TDD is how we have unit tests in place when we're finished with the implementation,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and that allows us to make changes in the future to the code.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We also looked at unit testing controllers.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
"MVC" makes controllers easy to test.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
For the most part, you just need to instantiate them and pass

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
in parameters, and assert on the result.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We just have to make sure the code we write inside the controller is testable.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And we looked at using fake testables to give us complete control over the execution environment

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
for a controller, and avoid using a database in our unit tests.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If you're new to unit testing, I really hope this module has given you some inspiration

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to try it out.
