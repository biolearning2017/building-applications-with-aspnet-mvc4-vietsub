1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
When the mvc framework is selecting one of your controllers public methods to invoke

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
as an action it will use any action selector attributes that might be present

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
to find the correct action to invoke.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
One such selector is the action name selector, when you apply this attribute

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
to a controller action it specifies the action name for the method or the edit method

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
that we see here we can no longer reach this method as an action named edit we have

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
to reach it as an action named modify, action name is an attribute you can use when you went

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
to alias, the name of your action methods.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Accept verbs on the other hand will specify the http verb that is allowed

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
to reach a particular action, you can say that an action method is only reachable

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
with an http get request or an http post request or delete or put

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
or some combination of those verbs.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The accept attribute will become extremely important later when we start modifying data,

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we'll be using both get and post then but right now we're just using get

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
but I'm introducing this topic now so you're ahead of the game.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's see how this works in visual studio.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Inside of our search action let's change it back to returning a simple content result

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
with a message that we've computed

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
but I will make one more change I will add an attribute here that says

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
that you can only invoke this during an http post message and now if I do a build

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and refresh the browser on slash cuisine I'll get the 404 error message,

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
essentially the mvc framework could not find an action it could invoke

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
in response to this get request.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
A get request is what a browser sends off by default if you just type some something

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
into the address bar and hit enter.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
On the other hand if I had specified http get and now do a build

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and a refresh everything should work just fine because now the mvc framework can find an action

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
to invoke and we see French again because that's the default value for this parameter.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let me give you a preview of why this is extremely useful.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What happens if we had two actions both with the name of search, the first problem here is

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
that the c sharp compiler will be unhappy

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
because these methods have the exact same signature, the same name or the same number

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
of parameters we wouldn't be able to get this to build but let's take the parameter off

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and instead of returning content with the message, let me just return content

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
that says search and now do a build and come out and refresh the browser.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We'll get a different sort of error, the mvc framework sees

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
that it should invoke a search action but it's not going to try to distinguish

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
between the two search actions that we have, one that takes a string,

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
one that doesn't have any parameters it's just going to throw

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
up its hands and throw an exception.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
There's some scenarios later in this course where it's going to be very useful

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
to have two different versions of an action and have one respond to an http get request only

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and have the other one respond only to an http post request

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and now by placing these attributes here the mvc framework can clearly see

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
that if it's a get request for search it should go to this action and display research,

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
if it's a post request for search it will come over to this one.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So I just did a build and if I refresh now we should get rid

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
of the error and we get a search text.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Again that's because the mcv framework chose this one, it was an http get request,

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
it saw the search action...it saw

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
that this first one was only legal during a post so it selected the second one.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Just remember this discussion when we come back to modifying data later.
