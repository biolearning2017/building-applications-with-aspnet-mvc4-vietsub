1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This module was a stepping stone to give us some of the foundational knowledge that we need

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
to know about how mvc works before we can move on and build out our application.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I demonstrated how to use the routing api's to route requests to controllers

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and how to receive parameters in my action methods that arrive in the URL and query string,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
we also looked at action filters and different types of action results,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:59:00,000
these action results will come in useful in future modules.
